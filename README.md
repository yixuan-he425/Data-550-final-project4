# Final Project 4

This repository contains all the components for Final Project 4, including data, code, and the final report.

## Directory Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset (`heart.csv`).
- **code/**: Contains R scripts used to generate outputs:
  - `table.R`: Contains code for generating the required table.
  - `figure.R`: Contains code for generating the required figure.
- **report/**: Contains the R Markdown file (`report.Rmd`) and a html file (`report.html`)  used to build the final report.
- **Makefile**: Contains a rule for building the final report. Running `make` will render `report.Rmd` into a html report.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How to Generate the Final Report

1. Ensure that Git, R, and the required R packages (e.g., `rmarkdown`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`) are installed.
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the project root directory, and run:

make

This command will use the Makefile to render `report/report.Rmd` and produce the final report (`report.html`).

## Code Details

- **Table Generation**: The required table is generated by the code in `code/table.R`.
- **Figure Generation**: The required figure is generated by the code in `code/figure.R`.
